# React simon

Simon game implemented in react.

## Potential improvements
- [x] Add sound
- [x] Add gameover sound
- [x] Add highscore and score
- [ ] Make it look prettier (:
- [ ] Allow for multiple at once (possible via keyboard shortcuts).
- [ ] Figure out a good UX for telling the user they can use shortcuts to control it... If they click settings it is obvious but if they don't, they might never know.
- [ ] Potentially make the keyboard shortcuts section collapsed by default to save space and make mobile users less confused.
